<p class="p2"><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong><span class="s1">DO </span></strong></span>Place your hands on the ground in front of you and walk your body out so you are in a push up position. Keeping your body straight and solid like you would in a plank, bring 1 knee up to your chest and then rapidly switch knees. You&rsquo;re essentially doing high-knees in a horizontal position.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1" style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>DONT</strong> </span>Drop your hips low to the ground OR elevate your hips into the air. Think of the initial push up position similarly to a plank position, your body needs to be straight and solid, so that your upper body really feels the strain of the push up movement itself.</p>
