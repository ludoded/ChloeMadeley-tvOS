<h2 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">3. Bicycles</span></h2>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">DO</span> </span></strong>Lie on your back and bend your knees. Lift your upper body towards your knees, bringing your right elbow across to your left knee as you do, so you perform a sort of diagonal crunch. Staying in the crunch position, then bring your left elbow across to your right knee - and so on and so forth.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1" style="color: #ff00ff;">DONT </span></strong>Let yourself drop out of the crunch position. Once you have performed that first bicycle, stay in the v position as you switch elbows and direction. Make sure the strain is on your core throughout.</p>
