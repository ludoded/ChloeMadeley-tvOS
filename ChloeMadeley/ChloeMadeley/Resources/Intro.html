<p class="p1"><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Welcome</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Hi I&rsquo;m Chloe Madeley. Welcome to my 15-minute Fat Loss Circuits.</strong></p>
<p class="p2">I&rsquo;m going to be your personal trainer. All I ask is that you really push yourself for 15 minutes every single day.</p>
<p class="p2">I have designed four fat loss circuits for you guys.</p>
<p class="p2">Each one targets a different area: your upper body, mid-section, lower body and finally an all over cardiovascular serious fat-burning circuit.</p>
<p class="p2">In every circuit there are four exercises. I want you to perform them for one minute each, back to back.</p>
<p class="p2">Then rest for one minute. Repeat the circuit twice more.</p>
<p class="p2">That brings you to a grand total of 15 minutes, which really is all you need when it comes to this kind of high-intensity training, fat-burning exercises.</p>
<p class="p2">So, when you&rsquo;re ready&hellip;let&rsquo;s go!</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Stretch and warm up</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2">Before your perform each circuit, remember that you must ALWAYS warm up and warm down so you avoid injury. I do this every day without fail.</p>
<p class="p2">Warm ups should be gentle but slightly dynamic, similar to the exercises themselves, but with a slow and calm performance, for 8-10 seconds.</p>
<p class="p2">Warm downs should be static. You want to stretch out each muscle singularly and hold the stretch, again for 8-10 seconds.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Warning!</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Exercise safely</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2">While performing these circuits you should be out of breath, sweating and or in muscular discomfort.</p>
<p class="p2">However, if you feel something pull sharply, hear any strange internal noises, vomit, find that any of your peripheral senses are distorted, and or feel generally unwell, you must stop immediately.</p>
<p class="p2">Please also bear in mind that when you are ill, your heart becomes enlarged, and you are at a greater risk of heart attacks during exercise.</p>
<p class="p2">Chloe Madeley cannot be held responsible for injury or death of any persons following these circuits.</p>
<p class="p2">All exercises are at the individual&rsquo;s own risk. If in doubt, seek medical advice.</p>
