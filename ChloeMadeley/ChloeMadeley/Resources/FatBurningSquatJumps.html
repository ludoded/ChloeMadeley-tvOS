<h2 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff00ff; font-size: 40pt;">3. Squat Jumps</span></h2>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1" style="color: #ff00ff;">DO </span></strong>Stand up straight, place your feet hip-width apart. Keeping your back straight and upright, bend your knees and lower your bottom to the ground. Keep your knees directly above your toes. As you start to extend your knees to stand back up, perform a small jump, landing back into the initial position.</p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong><span class="s1">DONT </span></strong></span>Bend forward. This is not a back bending exercise. Keep your back upright and straight. Don&rsquo;t let your knees invert, try and keep them pointing forwards, directly above your knees. Don&rsquo;t do a tiny little movement, squat down as low as you can and then perform a small jump.</p>
