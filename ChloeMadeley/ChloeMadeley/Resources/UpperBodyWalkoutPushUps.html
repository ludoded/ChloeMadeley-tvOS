<h2 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">2. Walkout Push Ups</span></h2>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">DO</span> </span></strong>Place your hands on the ground in front of you and walk your body out so you are in a push up position. Keeping your body straight and solid like you would in a plank, lower your nose to the ground and then push up, returning to the initial position.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1" style="color: #ff00ff;">DONT </span></strong>Drop your hips low to the ground OR elevate your hips into the air. Think of the initial push up position similarly to a plank position, your body needs to be straight and solid, so that your upper body really feels the strain of the push up movement itself.</p>
