<p class="p2"><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong><span class="s1">DO </span></strong></span>Get on all fours and bring your right knee into your chest, then slowly extend the leg behind yourself and up into the air, pointing your toe at your leg&rsquo;s vertical peak. Repeat this movement for half the time required, and then switch legs.</p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong><span class="s1">DONT </span></strong></span>Get excited and go too fast. This is one of those weird exercises that you don&rsquo;t really feel until the next day. To get the full benefit of the exercise, you need to really think about the movement and muscles required, and perform methodically.</p>
