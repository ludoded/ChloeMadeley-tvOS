<h2 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">4.Burpees</span></h2>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1" style="color: #ff00ff;">DO </span></strong>Squat down low to the ground, place your hands out in front of you and jump your legs out behind you so you are in a push up position. Quickly jump your feet back up to your hands again, returning to the initial position. Stand upright and jump up into the air before repeating the movement.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1" style="color: #ff00ff;">DONT </span></strong>Let yourself slack off. Burpees are hard but they are in these circuits for a reason &ndash; they are an all over body resistance exercise and also incredible cardio, meaning they will burn serious amounts of glycogen, fat and calories. Give them everything you&rsquo;ve got!</p>
