<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1" style="color: #ff00ff;">DO </span></strong>Find an elevated surface and face away from it. Place the palms of your hands on the edge of the surface and straighten your legs out in front of you, crossing your ankles. Keep your elbows tucked in and lower your body as low as you are able, before pushing yourself back up.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1" style="color: #ff00ff;">DONT </span></strong>Lower your bum to the ground and then thrust back up. This is NOT a hip thrust exercise; it is a tricep exercise, so be mindful that the triceps are the muscles that SHOULD be engaging. Don&rsquo;t extend your elbows outward, they should be tucked in, pointing behind your body.</p>
