<p class="p2"><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong><span class="s1">DO </span></strong></span>Lie on your stomach and then elevate your body using the backs of your forearms and balls of your feet. Make sure your bum isn&rsquo;t elevated in the air or that your hips aren&rsquo;t lowered to the ground. This move is called The Plank for a reason &ndash; be strong, solid and straight &ndash; think like a plank!</p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1" style="color: #ff00ff;">DONT </span></strong>Let your back dip or curve down - you want your bum in line with the rest of your body. Don&rsquo;t elevate your bum either. You want to feel the strain predominantly in your core.</p>
